                                    If there was a 6 star review this Egypt Tour Company would surely get it. Our travel planner and his people on the ground in Cairo, Aswan, Luxor and Hurghada made this trip seamless. Even with the speed bumps that Covid-19 laid in front of us our trip
                                    was super easy. We started planning this adventure a year ago. I can't imagine doing it without the expertise that our travel planner brought to the table. We felt 100% safe the entire journey. We visited 20+ world
                                    class archeological sites, many were World Heritage Sites. The tickets, private transportation and a trained Egyptologist were provided by our travel company the entire trip. The hotels were fantastic. The experience
                                    was incredible. Our travel planner customized our trip so we could scuba dive a few days in the Red Sea at the end of the tour. His man in Hurghada took care of getting us the necessary documents for our Covid test
                                    required to get back into the US. Our departure flight left Cairo at 2AM and his man on the ground was with us to make sure we breezed through customs and everything was in order. You just can't appreciate that kind
                                    of service until you see it in action. Special thanks to our guides in Cairo and in Luxor & Aswan. And our guide who met us at the beginning of our adventure and was there at the end (2AM) in the Cairo airport. You
                                    made this trip absolutely incredible. Thank you!

                                <p>I've been back from my trip to Costa Rica organized by this travel company for over two weeks now, and yet, not a day goes by where my husband or I make a comment about how incredible of an experience it was! 2020 has been
                                    a hard year for many people, and my husband and I knew that a getaway from home was the medicine we needed to lift our spirits. When I first spoke with our travel planner, we chatted about our desired trip length, general
                                    travel interests, budget and accommodation preferences. From there, he took to the drawing board and within a few days sent over a proposal that included time in Manuel Antonio and La Fortuna - the Arenal Volcano. Every
                                    hotel we stayed in and activity included in our itinerary was beyond incredible! The tours were a combination of private and small group, and for every excursion we were greeted with cheerful and informative guides
                                    and other travelers hungry to learn more about the beautiful country of Costa Rica. Many people are hesitant to travel during Covid-19, and I realize that not everyone can pack their bags and go. But if you are healthy
                                    and travel consciously, it is an amazing experience during these unprecedented times. The Costa Ricans have mastered moving around the pandemic with a grace that I wish my home country could mimic. There are constant
                                    temperature checks, masks required in public places, social.

                                <p>Our travel planner and her team pulled together an amazing trip in a challenging environment. I forgot how different the covid era is (which is a testament to the excellence of the trip that they put together) until I realized
                                    that the hotel next door to us in Dubrovnik was closed. Our travel planner intuitively knew where to include higher-end experiences -- Bibich food and wine pairing, private charter boat on Hvar, high end hotels but
                                    also located in the right place. And the pricing was very reasonable, given the customized experience. Anytime you are first dealing with a travel agency, there is a little bit of concern in the back of your head of
                                    what happens if something in the chain falls apart--I very quickly realized that I had no need to stress or worry about anything--everyone will show up as expected and the experience will be even better than I could
                                    imagine. Our travel planner was easy to work with on the planning--even though she had no way of knowing that we would actually go through with the itinerary (1 covid test, 4 flights were required for us to get to Split)
                                    she pulled together a complete itinerary very quickly and tweaked it to my requests almost instantly. Meeting her in Split, I am not surprised by how perfectly this trip turned out--she is a lovely person, but also
                                    one who is super organized as well as knowledgeable, both about Croatia and about the strengths of her sub-contractors. We loved our entire experience (the sights, the food, the people we met) and realized that the
                                    country is not one you visit only once, rather it is the type of place you return to again and again. We intend to do exactly that and have this Croatia travel agency plan all of those trips.</p>

                                <p>This was a trip of a lifetime. We worked well together, came up with an awesome itinerary for 6 weeks to New Zealand and Australia. You name it we were going to do it. This truly was an itinerary with planes, trains & automobiles.
                                    Let's not forget to include boats, helicopter, camel and kayak. We had such a variety of things planned including wine tasting in both NZ and Australia. I can't say enough good things about our travel company!!! In
                                    the planning stages they even spoke to us about where and when to go as far as seasons and which way to go whether it be Australia first or NZ. As it turned out, the recommendation to go to New Zealand first was perfect.
                                    We were saved the experience of Australia for only a few weeks and maybe being stuck there! No stone was left unturned, even when the fires occurred in Australia. Our impact was going to be minimal. We left the US on
                                    March 9th for NZ arriving on the 11th. No problems with Covid-19, we continued on with our itinerary. Sailing in the harbor in Auckland, wine tasting on a beautiful little island outside of Auckland. On to Queenstown
                                    which is delightful and Milford Sound for an overnight on a ship. Absolutely beautiful. Glad we did this vs a day trip or boat ride. We flew back to Queenstown, which I'd recommend because you have a great overview
                                    of the mountains. Breathtaking!! Picked up a rental car and drove to Franz Josef to climb the glacier. We're an older couple, but this was an incredible, first-time experience! My husband still marvels! We took a train
                                    to Christchurch which is still suffering the after effects of the 2011 earthquake. </p>

                                <p>Our trip planner did an absolutely exceptional job planning and managing our recent trip to Portugal. We planned the trip about 2 weeks before we left and she was able to pull it all together perfectly. Everything and every
                                    detail exceeded our already high expectations. We flew into Lisbon where she met us at the airport and drove us to the train to continue our travel to Porto. She had given great advice to get all the traveling done
                                    at once. We spent 3 days in Porto which included a day trip on a private wine tasting tour in the Duoro Valley. She was available 100% of the time to help give advice, answer questions etc. The hotels in both Porto
                                    and Lisbon were wonderful. She planned several events including an incredible food walking tour in Porto, a full day trip driving from Porto to Lisbon with several wonderful stops, a cooking class in Lisbon, and another
                                    wine tasting day trip to the Alentejo region and trip to Evora. Our trip was just perfect and I give our planner and this travel company top rating. On the last morning of our trip she and her partner picked us up at
                                    our hotel and drove us to the airport. I thought this was a really special touch and showed how much she cared to hear about our travels personally. I have planned a number of trips through Zicasso and can easily say
                                    that this trip planner and Company are by far one of the best travel agencies I have worked with. They didn't miss a thing and planned a wonderful trip for us.
